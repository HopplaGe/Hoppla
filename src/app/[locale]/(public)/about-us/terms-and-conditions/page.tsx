          Hoppla provides to users on the Platform a search engine based on
          different search criteria (Place of origin, destination, dates, number
          of travelers, etc.). Certain additional functionalities are provided
          on the search engine when the user is connected with his/her Account.
          Hoppla invites the user, regardless of the booking process used, to
          carefully consult and use the search engine to determine the offer
          that is most adapted to his/her needs. The Customer, booking a Bus
          Trip on a Point of Sales can also ask the Bus Operator or the desk

        When a Passenger is interested in a Carpooling Advert benefiting from
        Booking, he may make an online Booking request. This Booking request is
        either (i) accepted automatically (if the Driver chose this option when
        posting his Advert), or (ii) accepted manually by the Driver. At the
        time of the Booking, the Passenger makes the online payment of the Cost
        Contribution and the related Service Fees, where applicable. After
        receipt of the payment by Hoppla and validation of the Booking request
        by the Driver, where applicable, the Passenger receives a Booking
        confirmation (the “<strong>Booking Confirmation</strong>”).
      </p>
      <p className="text-justify">
        If you are a Driver and have chosen to handle manually the Bookings
        requests when posting your Advert, you are required to respond to any
        Booking request within the timeframe specified by the Passenger during
        the Booking request. Otherwise, the Booking request will expire
        automatically and the Passenger shall be refunded all sums paid at the
        time of the Booking request, if any.
      </p>
      <p className="text-justify">
        At the time of the Booking Confirmation, Hoppla will send you the
        telephone number of the Driver (if you are the Passenger) or of the
        Passenger (if you are the Driver), if the Member agreed to display
        his/her phone number. You are then solely responsible for executing the

      <p></p>
      <p className="text-justify">
        The Platform constitutes an online mobility platform on which the
        Members can create and post Carpooling Adverts for Carpooling Trips for
        the purposes of ridesharing. These Carpooling Adverts can notably be
        viewed by the other Members to find out the terms of the Trip, and where
        applicable, to directly book a Seat in the vehicle in question with the
        Member having posted the Advert on the Platform.{" "}
        <span className="font-semibold">
          The Platform also allows the Booking of Seats for Bus Trips.

      <p className="text-justify">
        In using the Platform and in accepting these T&amp;Cs, you recognise
        that Hoppla is not party to (i) any agreement entered into between you
        and the other Members with a view to sharing the costs relating to a
        Trip{" "}

        Hoppla has no control over the behaviour of its Members, the Bus
        Operator and their agents, and the users of the Platform. It does not
        own, exploit, supply or manage the vehicles subject of the Adverts, and
        it does not offer any Trips on the Platform.
      </p>
      <p className="text-justify">

        truthfulness or legality of the Adverts, Seats and Trips offered. In its
        capacity of cridesharing intermediary, Hoppla does not provide any
        transport service and does not act in the capacity of carrier; the role
        of Hoppla is limited to facilitating access to the Platform.
